# Allied Health Business Framework - Implementation Documentation

## Overview

This document provides detailed information about the implementation of the Allied Health Business Framework, focusing on the integration of domain-specific knowledge into the algorithms and data models. The framework has been enhanced with physiotherapy benchmarks, regulatory compliance requirements, fee schedules, and other domain-specific data to provide a comprehensive business assessment tool for allied health practices.

## Architecture

The Allied Health Business Framework follows a modular architecture with the following components:

1. **Data Models**: TypeScript interfaces and enums that define the structure of the data used throughout the application.
2. **Algorithms**: Core business logic components that perform calculations, analysis, and generate recommendations.
3. **Data Sources**: Static data files containing benchmarks, fee schedules, and compliance requirements.
4. **Supabase Integration**: Database integration layer that connects the algorithms with the Supabase backend.
5. **UI Components**: React components for the user interface (not modified in this phase).
